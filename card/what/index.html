    <h1>What's Library Card?</h1>
    <b>This page hasn't been updated in a while. You should be able to figure out the UI on your own.</b>
    <p>Library Card is an installable web app for your phone. You can use it to quickly flash your phone at a barcode scanner and log in quickly.</p>
    <a href="mailto:&#107;&#105;&#100;&#115;&#99;&#111;&#100;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#112;&#108;&#97;&#99;&#101;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;" class="padlink">Send feedback</a>
    <a href="/card/" class="padlink">Go home</a>
    <h2>Quick start:</h2>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Tap on "Setup your card".</li>
      <li>Tap on the box under "Card number" and enter in your library card number.</li>
      <li>Tap on the box under "Card PIN" and enter in your library card number.</li>
      <li>Tap on "Save".</li>
      <li>Scroll down and click on "Add to Home Screen" so you don't lose the page.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Use</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>When you want to use it, open Library Card, and align your phone with the scanner.</li>
      <li>Choose "Show card", and your phone will flash your library card!</li>
      <li>Do your regular library checkout, really quickly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Advanced guide:</h2>
    <p>To set it up, tap "Setup your card". If this button doesn't show, you might've already set it up.</p>
    <p>If you've already set it up, then choose "Change card details".</p>
    <p>Then tap on the field below "Card number:" and enter in your library card.</p>
    <p>After that, tap on the field below "Card PIN:" and enter in your library card PIN. Note:</p>
    <p>No data is purposely stored on my own or GitHub's servers. Instead I use a third party service, bwipjs-api.metafloor.com, and that's just for generating .</p>
    <p>Then tap "Save". Your library card data is stored, and if you refresh the page, it'll be kept as long as you don't clear site data.</p>
    <p>To reconfigure the settings, choose "Change card details".</p>
    <p>To find the saved barcode number, tap on "Show card details".</p>
    <p>To use it, tap on "Show card", and your phone will flash two barcodes. The first one is your number and the second one is your PIN.</p>
    <p>To add it to your home screen, scroll down and click on "Add to Home Screen".</p>
    <p>Tap it first to find where it'll show them. Then tap it again, while that part of the phone is aligned with the barcode scanner. You should be logged in in less than 2 seconds!</p>
