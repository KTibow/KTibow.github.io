		<h1>Installing Pip from Python on Arduino Yun</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before everything, make sure your Yun is plugged in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if you think it seems reasonable and you know how, back up your Arduino Yun. Done? Great. Let's keep going.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, reset your Arduino Yun by holding the button called "WLAN RST" next to the USB port for 30 seconds. Wait 5 or so minutes.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then check your WiFi networks. You should see a WiFi network called "Arduino YÃºn-XXXXXXXXXXXX". Connect to it. It won't have Internet. That's okay.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your web browser. Type in "192.168.240.1". You might see a security warning. That's okay too. In a moment, you'll be asked for your password. Use "arduino".
