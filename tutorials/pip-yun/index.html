		<h1>Installing Pip from Python on Arduino Yun</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before everything, make sure your Yun is plugged in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if you think it seems reasonable and you know how, back up your Arduino Yun. Done? Great. Let's keep going.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, reset your Arduino Yun by holding the button called "WLAN RST" next to the USB port for 30 seconds. Wait 5 or so minutes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then check your WiFi networks. You should see a WiFi network called "Arduino Yún-XXXXXXXXXXXX". Connect to it. It won't have Internet. That's okay.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your web browser. Type in "192.168.240.1". You might see a security warning. That's okay too. In a moment, you'll be asked for your password. Use "arduino".<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, once you're logged in, click on the "Configure" button. Make sure you change the Yún name and password, and the time zone too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, click on the dropdown menu under Wireless Parameters called "Detected Wireless Networks". Change it to the name of a WiFi network <u>you</u> can connect to.
