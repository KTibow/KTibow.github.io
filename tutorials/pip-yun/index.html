		<h1>Installing Pip from Python on Arduino Yun</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before everything, make sure your Yun is plugged in.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if you think it seems reasonable and you know how, back up your Arduino Yun. Done? Great. Let's keep going.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, reset your Arduino Yun by holding the button called "WLAN RST" next to the USB port for 30 seconds. Wait 5 or so minutes.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then check your WiFi networks. You should see a WiFi network called "Arduino Yún-XXXXXXXXXXXX". Connect to it. It won't have Internet. That's okay.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your web browser. Type in "192.168.240.1". You might see a security warning. That's okay too. In a moment, you'll be asked for your password. Use "arduino".</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, once you're logged in, click on the "Configure" button. Make sure you change the Yún name and password, and the time zone too.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, click on the dropdown menu under Wireless Parameters called "Detected Wireless Networks". Change it to the name of a WiFi network <u>you</u> can connect to.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if your network has a password, enter it. Click "Configure & Restart", and pretty soon, we can start on installing pip!</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once it's restarted, connect to the WiFi network connect to where you told the Yun to connect to (WiFi). Now, open your command prompt.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're on Windows, make sure you have the April 2019 update for Windows 10. If you have an older version:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>YOU <u><b>WILL</b></u> GET HACKED!</li>
			<li>This tutorial will be a <u>lot</u> harder.</li>
			<li>I know you're used to your old version, but Windows 10 has a <u>lot</u> more features.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you're using a new version  of Linux, Mac OS, or Windows 10, keep going.</p>
