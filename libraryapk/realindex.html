    <h2>It's time!</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that time of the year has finally came. Many say, and I agree, that it's "The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year!"</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here's your gift! An electronic library card app.</p>
    <h2>Let's go!</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really a great app. And it's fairly simple to get.</p>
    <h2>Wait a minute...</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's still a lot to go over! Let's look at them in a list.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, I want to tell you that once you download this app, the link you used expires.</li>
      <li>Second, I want to make sure that you know that this app is totally clean. There is nothing bad in here.</li>
    </ul>
