    <h2>It's time!</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that time of the year has finally came. Many say, and I agree, that it's "The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year!"</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here's your gift! An electronic library card app.</p>
    <h2>Let's go!</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really a great app. And it's fairly simple to get.</p>
    <h2>Wait a minute...</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's still a lot to go over! Let's look at them in a list.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, I want to tell you that once you download this app, the link you used expires.</li>
      <li>Second, I want to make sure that you know that this app is totally clean. There is nothing bad in here.</li>
	  <li>Third, I want to let you know that I haven't completely finished development yet.</li>
	  <li>Fourth, I want to let you know that it's a bit hard to install the app, so let's go over that!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>As soon as you click the link, it will say "This kind of file can harm your device. Do you want to keep Library.apk anyway?" But don't worry, because my app won't hurt a fly. So press "Keep/Yes".</p>
	<p>Now, as soon as you open the file to install the app, it'll say "For security reasons, your device is not allowed to install apps from this source." In order to install the app, click the button that says "Settings", and find the app you opened the file with. Turn on the switch that says "Allow from this source", and press the back button until you get out of settings.</p>
	<p>I don't really know what'll happen next, but just keep clicking the buttons that let you install the app. You <b>do</b> trust me, right?</p>
