    <h1>Library Card App Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>Do you not know what this is? It's one of my hobbies. I'm making an Android app that can act as your library card, so you don't lose it. It's not public yet because I'm under the required age to publish to the Google Play store. So just forget about this.</p>
    <p>"Disclaimer" is defined as "a notice for reading that lets you know about any rules".</p>
    <p>"Public" is defined as "any living thing that isn't in my close family".</p>
    <p>"Installing" is defined as "doing anything with an APK".</p>
    <p>"APK" is defined as "any file that contains anything unique from my work on my app".</p>
    <p>"File" is defined as "a specific piece of data".</p>
    <p>"Responsible" is defined as "being the cause of something".</p>
    <p>"Agree" is defined as "to have the same opinion about something".</p>
    <p>"Intentionally" is defined as "knowingly doing something".</p>
    <p>"Loophole" is defined as "a ambiguity or inadequacy in the law or a set of rules, including terms of service".</p>
    <p>This disclaimer applies to all apps I share with the public.</p>
    <p>By installing this app, you agree that I am not responsible for any bad or unwanted effects.</p>
    <p>I agree that I did not intentionally cause any bad or unwanted effects that may occur, and that I did not find out about them then just do nothing.</p>
    <p>By installing this app, you agree to not share the app file (.apk) with others without my permission.</p>
    <p>I agree to help you with any troubles you have, if reasonable.</p>
    <p>By installing this app, you agree that you will not try to find any loopholes.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
