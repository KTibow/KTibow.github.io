        <h1>Some new random stuff</h1>
        <p>Well, first of all, schoology.css is out. I've spent more than a month working on it. <a href="/schoology.css">Learn more</a></p>
        <p>Second, sometime I want to wipe this website, and start mostly from scratch. I'm remaking common.js, mainly because of GA4.
        And... This post is about it, mainly. First of all, some privacy policies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google's policy on partner sites</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's own policy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now some other stuff.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/">Opt out of personalized ads</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization">Google account personalization opt-out</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Install the Google Analytics opt out extension</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyway... It's been a long time since I worked on this website. I've been busy on so many stuff. But I hope I can still maintain it.</p>
