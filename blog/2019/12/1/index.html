<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time for winter! We got a Christmas
tree, and put the lights up. I made a nice little gadget that turns
the lights on and off. It has a proximity sensor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a pretty good Thanksgiving! As
always, the stuffing was the best. We made some jello cranberry
salad too. It was yummy! (We have leftovers, but we're about to
finish them up.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I messed around with QR codes a bit! I
made a little "badge" that scans to my website. I used a website
called <a href="https://www.qr-code-generator.com">QR Code
Generator</a>. It's pretty handy. By the way, try using it to make
a WiFi QR code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also set up some devices! I set up a
Tile Mate, and a wireless headphone. It took some time, but it was
fun!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and what did I do on the parent
confrence days, with extra-short school days? A variety **edit:**
of random stuff!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, if you're reading this, please
email me to write another blog post soon! Bye!</p>
