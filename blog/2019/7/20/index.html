        <p>Date: 7/20/2019</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another day with a website! Today morning, I moved from 000webhost to byethost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a list of some free web hosts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>000webhost (not reccommended, previous hoster)</li>
            <li>byethost (current hoster)</li>
            <li>InfinityFree (I had trouble because they were too complex)</li>
            <li>Googiehost (never heard of, probably never will get familiar with them)</li>
            <li>FreeHostingNoAds (name is appealing)</li>
            <li>FreeWebHostingArea (just another choice)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of those websites came from TechRadar. A lot were disqualified, so I'll quote those here:
            "<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;Freevirtualservers, Freehosting, Freehostia and Awardspace: All these were removed because they either require you to buy a domain name from them, or transfer your own.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;X10hosting: The login section no longer works.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;Uhostfull: We were not able to create a new account because it kept complaining about non-valid characters for a non-existent domain field.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;Instafree: It has a very convoluted signup process requiring you to give your date of birth and gender before waiting up to 48 hours for approval.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;5GBfree and Hoophost: They no longer accept new accounts. Hoophost candidly admitted that this was because of spam accounts.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;AdvancedFreeWebHost: This provider wants you to subscribe to a YouTube channel and remain subscribed to it. Failure to do so will see your account deleted." - techradar.com </p>
        <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-free-web-hosting">The actual website</a>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's also some familiar choices out there that you pay for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Squarespace</li>
            <li>Wix</li>
            <li>Weebly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But enough talk about web hosting. Let me poke another hole in that telephone, and I'll tell you some more about my life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my rough location is in Washington, in the USA. (Not Washington, DC.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have mistated in my last post that technology is just something I like. Really, it's one of my hobbies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's some tech stuff that I know about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raspberry Pis (I wish they came from the USA, but the UK's gonna do what the UK's gonna do.)</li>
            <li>Arduinos</li>
            <li>Makey Makeys</li>
            <li>Roombas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to unpack my whole life in one post, though, so I'm going to stop now! See you later!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UPDATE: Now I'm hosting on Github Pages. I hope to unpack enough soon that I just need to tell you about the daily stuff.</p>
