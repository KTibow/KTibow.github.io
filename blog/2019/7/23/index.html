		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew! My life is so busy, I forgot to fill in and make blog posts for 3 days! I'm back at it now, though.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I remembered today! So this week, I'm doing a 2-part camp. In the morning, I'm doing Pedalheads. Let me tell you a little about that.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as you might guess by the name, it's a bicycling camp. Here's a link to their website: </p>
		<a href="https://www.pedalheads.com/">(this is it)</a>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm at level 3. That means that I'm going to learn about hand signals and shoulder checks. I'm really excited.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, my afternoon camp is a web development camp. I like it too!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, later this week, I'm excited to help my dad set up SimpliSafe, since we ordered it this weekend.</p>
