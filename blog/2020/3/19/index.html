        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to start doing my writing here. As I might have mentioned, I live in Redmond, Washington. The governor is making kids stay at home, so my mom's "homeschooling" me. Basically, that means she makes me walk, do math, and write. It's okay!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I'm going to start writing. Again, I'm in isolation.</p>
