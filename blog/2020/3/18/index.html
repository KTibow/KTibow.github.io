<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it's time for me to do another
one. To help you have some fun during isolation, or anytime, LG
makes some really funny ads. Here's some of the best:</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8SoVDiiKV8">The Power Of
Water</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSfXQyLtiG0">Don't Miss
Your Moments</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAV1DNuXht0">TWINWash
Dance Challenge</a><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these are really funny, and
should help you laugh a little. By the way, for some reason, it's
exactly 2 months (exactly as in day level) since my last post.
Hm!</p>
