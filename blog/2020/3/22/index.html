        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is jsut a quick hop in for now, but here's an idea. You know how when you fill up a water bottle, it makes a sound? You know how the more you fill it the higher the sound is? Well, you could take an FFT and pass it to AI that automatically filled a glass with water the right amount no matter the glass. Take that, weight sensors!</p>
