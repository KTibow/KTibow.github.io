        <h1>2020</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a whole lotta snow! Well, this is my first 2020 blog post. I hope you're doing well!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I've started coding in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>. It's actually pretty good! It's a nice alternative to Python, and it works on Android, desktop, and even (kinda) iOS!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started using Kotlin because drag and drop wasn't good enough for making Android apps. It integrates pretty well with Android Studio, and here's a cool feature: if you have some Java code, it'll convert it to Kotlin for you!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what else is going on? As I mentioned, we had some snow. Lots of it! This week, we didn't go to school Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday! On Thursday, I was two hours late, and on Friday, it was a regular school day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing: I'm in Cub Scouts, so I had the Pinewood Derby on Thursday evening. Here's some interesting facts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We had a really long track this year!</li>
            <li>This year, we own our own equipment for the derby!</li>
            <li>We also had Instant Replay, which means we get to watch the cars hit the finish line, but up on the screen. It was a little laggy, though!</li>
            <li>We had the car in lane #1 get #1, the car in lane #2 get #2, the car in lane #3 get #3, and the car in lane #4 get lane #4 at least once.</li>
            <li>We had the car in lane #1 get #4, the car in lane #2 get #3, the car in lane #3 get #2, and the car in lane #4 get lane #1 at least two times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, happy 2020! Don't get to much spam from the eye doctor saying "Are your eyes 20/20 in 2020?"</p>
