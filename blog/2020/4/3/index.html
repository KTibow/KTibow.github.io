<h1>4/3/2020</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is fun! Our next distanced
learning thing is journaling. So this is school now! üòä</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to have to wait 14 posts until
I can submit this. But don't worry, you'll still have great
content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, it might be a bit more boring.
(I now have to put a date at the top.) I'll try to still keep it
exciting! Here we go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was saying I could write about my
day. It's the morning, though, so I'll write a bit about yesterday.
My dad hooked me up with his Kindle fire. It has the ability of
"Show Mode", though. What does that mean? It can be an Echo Show!
Yes, it can do everything a regular Echo Show can do, and it has a
bigger screen and a battery. The only bad thing is that its
speakers aren't great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to today, I'm trying to make a stand
for it. Its case has a prop, but it takes up space, so you can't
put stuff behind it. (Yes, I know the regular Echo Show takes up
its behind with speakers. I still want to have an empty behind.) I
want to mount it on the side of a cuboard. I'm trying to not hang
it, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also set up the Echo Dot in my room
(3rd generation)! I'm going to start trying to track my sleep by
saying "Alexa, note that I went to bed at 9:30." Quick off, time
for me to maybe share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I got called on. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What are the
chances? Well, my people were saying this is supposed to be a "time
capsule", so here we go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now we're having a pandemic! Eek!
I just don't let my parents tell me it's a big thing. Also, since
we're supposed to be home (to prevent virus spread) and I'm an
introvert that's good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting confused. Maybe that's
because I'm hungry and I'm writing this during a video confrence
with the volume up. Let me turn it down. ‚è¨ Yay! Relief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ugh. This is supposed to be organized.
Don't people know the wonderfullnance of unorginization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, I'm not going to do all of the
work. Take this <a href=

coronavirus information archive</a>. Ha!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is getting boring. RESTART!</p>

<p>Because I really love to make, love to make, love to make, DIY
