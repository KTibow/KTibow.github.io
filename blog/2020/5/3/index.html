        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are notes for the future. Here they go:</p>
        <p>At the first time, everybody on the news was going "Coronavirus, coronavirus" and nobody paid attention.</p>
        <p>But then things got more serious. There's rumors everything will open soon, but we'll see.</p>
        <p>We used something called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200502225919/https://edu.google.com/intl/en/products/classroom/">Google Classroom</a> to get assignments. A lot of mornings, our teacher uses something called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200503005338/https://zoom.us/">Zoom Meetings</a> and we can do video conferences where we can see eachother's faces and what they say. We can't touch the people.</p>
        <p>As for the funny stuff? Everybody's buying toilet paper. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200503154924/https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=toilet+paper+memes&form=HDRSC2&first=1&cw=1905&ch=912">It's a giant meme.</a> There's also the things about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200502223411/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPDPzbLFeP4">the president talking about drinking cleaning fluids</a>(BAD IDEA!)</p>
        <p>Today I learned how to make a link look like it goes somewhere but go somewhere else. It can be used for good or bad. Here's an <a href="https://google.com/" onClick='document.getElementById("bingtrick").href="https://bing.com/"' id="bingtrick">example</a>. It looks like it goes to Google, but as soon as you click on it it opens Bing. I set the href to Google, but I also set an ID and an onClick. The onClick finds this element and changes the href to Bing. Tricky, huh?<p>
