        <h1>9/26/2020: Virtual clothes with Zoom</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom has a neat feature: Virtual Background. It lets you replace your background with any picture or video, either using AI or a green screen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wear a vibrant shirt without wrinkles, though, you can use it for your shirts!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, you're probably not going to email me. The only visitors I see are from other countries. And yes, I won't check my spam folder. And yes, I will know your email address if you email me. But I don't want to set up any other services, because I already juggle multiple tasks. So email me at k i d s c o d i n g p l a c e @ g m a i l . c o m</p>
