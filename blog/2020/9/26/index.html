        <h1>9/26/2020: Virtual clothes with Zoom</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom has a neat feature: Virtual Background. It lets you replace your background with any picture or video, either using AI or a green screen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use it for your shirts as well, though!</p>
        <img src="people.png">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, open the Virtual Background tab, and select your background of choice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, check "I have a green screen".</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so here's the criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The shirt is a vibrant color, or not similar <b>at all</b> to your skin tone, your face, or your surroundings.</li>
            <li>The shirt is a solid color. No stripes, poka-dots, or gradients.</li>
            <li>The shirt has no wrinkles, and the light evenly lights up your shirt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now click on the color picker (the rectangle that showed up when you clicked that checkbox), and click on your shirt. Repeat until it looks good.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yay! You're done! Some recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your camera might take a bit to warm up, so wait 5 seconds or so. You can warm it up while your video is stopped by opening the Virtual Background window, waiting 5 seconds, and then hitting start video.</li>
            <li>Try taking a picture of your room to have transparent clothes. Make sure it isn't mirrored, the camera stays at the same angle, and if you have a spin chair that you keep it in the same place.</li>
            <li>Try using fullscreen colors to have a red, orange, yellow, etc shirt. Also try patterns, and logos (use MS Paint to move them to the position of your shirt).</li>
        </ul>
